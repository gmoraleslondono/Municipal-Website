      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr>
      <article>
        <p>In August 1541, Marshal Jorge Robledo was in the place known today as Heliconia when he saw in the distance
          what he thought was a valley. He sent Jerónimo Luis Tejelo to explore the territory, and during the night of
          August 23 Tejelo reached the plain of what is now Aburrá Valley. The Spaniards gave it the name of "Valley
          of Saint Bartholomew", but this was soon changed for the native name Aburrá, meaning "Painters", due to the
          textile decorations of the natives.</p>
        <p>In 1616, the colonial visitor Francisco de Herrera y Campuzano founded a settlement with 80 Amerindians,
          naming it Poblado de San Lorenzo, today "El Poblado". In 1646 a colonial law ordered the separation of
          Amerindians from mestizos and mulattos, so the colonial administration began the construction of a new
          town in Aná, today Berrío Park, where the church of Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Aná ("Our Lady
          of Candelaria of Aná") was built. Three years later, the Spaniards started the construction of the Basilica
          of Our Lady of Candelaria, which was rebuilt at the end of the 18th century.</p>
        <p>In the first half of the twentieth century, the population of Medellín increased sixfold, from 59,815
          inhabitants in 1905 to 358,189 in 1951. The Thousand Days War (1899–1902) stopped the industrial development
          of the city, although the civil war did not affect the region directly. Under reforms by President Rafael
          Reyes after the conflict, the city continued its industrial development[14] and founded a Chamber of commerce.
          The Chamber developed a regional transport project that connected Medellín to other Colombian regions and
          other nations.</p>
